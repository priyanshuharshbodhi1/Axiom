## How Kiro Uses This Context

### Steering Files (`/steering/`)
These markdown files provide Kiro with persistent knowledge about Axiom.ai:

- **Always included** in every Kiro interaction
- **Consistent code generation** following our established patterns
- **Reduced repetition** - no need to re-explain project conventions
- **Team alignment** - all developers work with the same standards

### Specification Files (`/specs/`)
Detailed feature specifications that guide implementation:

- **Structured requirements** with acceptance criteria and implementation phases
- **Technical specifications** including TypeScript interfaces and component architecture  
- **User stories** that maintain focus on user value and experience
- **Phase-based implementation** breaking complex features into manageable tasks

### Automation Hooks (`/hooks/`)
Intelligent triggers that respond to development events:

- **Code quality enforcement** through automated linting and validation
- **Test generation** for new React components and API routes
- **Build validation** before merging to ensure system stability  
- **Deployment monitoring** with pre/post-deployment checks

## Kiro Development Workflow

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
```bash
# Kiro uses specs to understand feature requirements
"Build the workflow builder according to .kiro/specs/workflow-builder-spec.md"
```

### 2. Context-Aware Code Generation  
```bash
# Kiro generates code following our established patterns
"Create a new API route for workflow execution following our API standards"
```

### 3. Automated Quality Assurance
```bash
# Hooks trigger automatic code review and testing
FileEditedHook â†’ "Review this component for TypeScript errors and best practices"
```

### 4. Consistent Architecture
```bash  
# Steering files ensure architectural consistency
"Add a new data source node type to the workflow system"
# â†’ Kiro understands our React Flow architecture and TypeScript patterns
```

## Development Phases Completed with Kiro

## Getting Started with Kiro

### For New Team Members
1. **Read the steering files** to understand project architecture and conventions
2. **Review existing specs** to understand feature implementation patterns  
3. **Use Kiro chat** referencing specific steering files for context-aware assistance

### For Feature Development
1. **Create or update specs** for new features in `.kiro/specs/`
2. **Reference steering files** when asking Kiro to implement features
3. **Let hooks automate** code quality and testing workflows

### For Code Review
1. **Leverage automated hooks** for initial code quality validation
2. **Use Kiro analysis** for performance and architecture review
3. **Update steering files** when establishing new patterns or standards

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **Quarterly review** of steering files to reflect architecture evolution
- **Update specs** as features are implemented and requirements change  
- **Refine hooks** based on development workflow feedback and pain points

### Quality Assurance
- **Monitor hook effectiveness** through development velocity metrics
- **Validate Kiro suggestions** against actual implementation outcomes
- **Collect team feedback** on steering file accuracy and usefulness
