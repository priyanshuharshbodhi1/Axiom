# Workflow Builder Specification

## Overview
Visual drag-and-drop interface for creating automated trading and monitoring workflows using React Flow as the foundation.

## User Story
As a crypto trader, I want to create automated workflows by connecting data sources to actions, so that I can execute trades and monitor markets without manual intervention.

## Core Requirements

### Visual Interface
- **Canvas**: Infinite scrollable workspace with zoom controls
- **Node Palette**: Sidebar with draggable node types organized by category
- **Connection System**: Visual edges connecting node outputs to inputs
- **Real-time Preview**: Show data flow and execution status on canvas

### Node Types

#### Data Source Nodes
- **Price Feed Node**: CoinGecko API integration for cryptocurrency prices
- **DEX Data Node**: 1inch API for liquidity and trading data  
- **News Feed Node**: Crypto news aggregation and sentiment analysis
- **Custom API Node**: Generic HTTP endpoint connector

#### Logic Nodes  
- **Condition Node**: If/then logic with comparison operators
- **Math Node**: Mathematical operations and calculations
- **Timer Node**: Schedule-based triggers and delays
- **Filter Node**: Data filtering and transformation

#### Action Nodes
- **Trade Node**: Execute trades through DEX integration
- **Alert Node**: Send notifications via email, SMS, or webhook
- **Webhook Node**: HTTP requests to external services
- **Database Node**: Store data for historical analysis

### Data Flow
- **Type Safety**: Enforce compatible connections between node inputs/outputs
- **Real-time Validation**: Show connection errors and type mismatches
- **Data Preview**: Display sample data at each node during development
- **Execution Tracing**: Highlight active data flow during workflow runs

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Components
```typescript
interface WorkflowNode {
  id: string
  type: NodeType
  position: { x: number; y: number }
  data: NodeData
  inputs: NodePort[]
  outputs: NodePort[]
}

interface NodePort {
  id: string
  type: DataType
  label: string
  required: boolean
}

enum DataType {
  NUMBER = 'number',
  STRING = 'string', 
  BOOLEAN = 'boolean',
  PRICE_DATA = 'price_data',
  TRADE_SIGNAL = 'trade_signal'
}
```

### Backend Integration
- **Workflow Persistence**: Store workflow definitions in PostgreSQL
- **Execution Engine**: Process workflows using job queue system
- **API Integration**: Manage external API credentials and rate limiting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and retry logic

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Drag & Drop**: Smooth interaction with visual feedback
- **Contextual Help**: Inline documentation and examples for each node
- **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow templates for common use cases
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history management for workflow editing

## Acceptance Criteria

### Basic Functionality ✓
- [ ] Users can drag nodes from palette to canvas
