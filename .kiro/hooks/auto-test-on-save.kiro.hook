When a React component file is saved, automatically:

1. Run unit tests for the modified component
2. Check for TypeScript errors and type safety
3. Validate component props and hooks usage
4. Ensure accessibility standards are met
5. Run integration tests if component has external dependencies

Focus on:
- Testing component behavior, not implementation details
- Mocking external APIs (CoinGecko, 1inch) appropriately
- Validating React Flow node components work correctly
- Checking drag-and-drop functionality in workflow builder
