Before merging any branch to main:

1. Run complete Next.js build process
2. Execute full test suite (unit + integration)
3. Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
4. Validate ESLint rules and code formatting
5. Verify environment variables are properly configured
6. Test critical API endpoints (auth, workflows, trading)
7. Check bundle size hasn't increased significantly

Specific validation for Axiom.ai:
- React Flow workflow builder renders correctly
- CoinGecko and 1inch API integrations work
- Wallet connection and authentication flows
- Database migrations applied successfully
- Vercel deployment configuration is valid
